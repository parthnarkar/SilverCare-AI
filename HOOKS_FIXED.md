# 🔧 React Hooks and Router Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved:

### 1. **React Hooks Rule Violations** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** `React.useEffect` hooks were being called after conditional returns in several components, which violates the Rules of Hooks.

**Files Fixed:**
- `src/pages/Login.jsx`
- `src/pages/Signup.jsx` 
- `src/pages/UserDetails.jsx`

**Solution:** Moved all `useEffect` hooks to the top level of components, before any conditional returns.

### 2. **React Router Future Flag Warnings** ⚠️ → ✅
**Problem:** React Router v6 was showing warnings about upcoming v7 changes.

**Solution:** Added future flags to Router configuration in `App.jsx`:
```jsx
<Router
  future={{
    v7_startTransition: true,
    v7_relativeSplatPath: true,
  }}
>
```

## ✅ All Fixes Applied Successfully

### Before Fix:
```jsx
// ❌ WRONG - Hook after conditional return
if (loading) {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}

React.useEffect(() => {
  speak("Welcome message");
}, [speak]);
```

### After Fix:
```jsx
// ✅ CORRECT - All hooks at top level
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading) {
    speak("Welcome message");
  }
}, [speak, loading]);

if (loading) {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```
